Research Assistant is a tool to manage research projects by encoding
the dependencies between datasets, individual files, feature vectors,
and statistics.

It will (hopefully) be used to partition datasets, distribute work to
multiple computers on a network, ensure data consistency, and allow
a researcher to move from one dataset to another more easily.

At the moment, this is a pipe dream. But I see it.
